## Real-Time Analysis

The {word} operates in real time, using the [Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) to break down the signal into its constituent frequencies and plot their levels instantly.

<Info>The FFT size can be changed in `Settings` > `Metering` > `{word}` > `FFT Size`</Info>
